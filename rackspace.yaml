  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Magento Community Edition, the [Magento User
  Guide](http://www.magentocommerce.com/resources/user-guide-download) will
  step you through the process of configuring and managing your store. This
  guide is free, but does require you to provide a valid email address to
  receive it.

  The [Magento Forum](http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/) provides a place
  to get answers to both simple and advanced questions regarding configuration
  and management of Magento Community Edition.

  #### Logging into Magento
  To login, go to the URL listed above in a browser. If your DNS is not
  pointing to this installation, you can add a line in your [hosts
  file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  to point your domain to the IP of this Cloud Server. Once you've done this,
  restart your browser and navigate to the site. The backend can be accessed by
  adding '/admin' to the end of the URL, and you can login with the credentials
  provided above.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home). Once the deployment is
  up, Ansible will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) is used as the web server and listens on port
  80 to handle web traffic. The configuration for your site can be
  found in /etc/nginx/conf.d/. There will be a default site
  configuration and a seperate one for your domain. Magento itself is
  installed in /var/www/vhosts. You will find a directory with the name of
  website you entered as a part of this deployment.

  [PHP-FPM](http://php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php) is used to handle
  evaluation of all PHP-based pages. The configuration for this installation is
  in /etc/php5/fpm/pools/magento.conf. By default, PHP-FPM is running as the
  'magento' user, listens on 127.0.0.1:9001.

  Object and session caching are handled by
  [Redis](http://redis.io/). Redis is an in-memory, high performance key-value
  and is used for caching data and persisting user session data. This enhances
  the performance of your site by reducing expensive database calls. One persistent cache
  is configured. You can find the configuration in /etc/redis/.

  [Percona](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) database is
  installed on the instance as the data store.

  #### Magento Plugins
  There are thousands of plugins that have been developed for Magento by the
  developer community. [Magento
  Connect](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/) provides an easy
  way to discover popular plugins that other users have found to be helpful.
  Not all plugins are free, and we recommend only installing the plugins that
  you need.

  #### Additional Notes
  **This deployment is meant for development and testing scenarios only and is not
  intended for production use**.
